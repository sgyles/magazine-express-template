<p>Whether you live in a big city, or the suburbs, the environment in which you live/grow up in can affect your mental health. People existing with mental health issues are more likely to be living in poor living conditions. Some of the issues that may occur in places of this kind includes health hazards, monthly check-ins, and the struggles of affordability. People who do not live with mental health issues are people who live in wealthy conditions, and only worry about few issues such as the color they might want their fence, or whether or not they would like a pool etc. Although, you may feel that theses living conditions may not apply to you and you might feel as though you can survive perfectly fine with some difficulty at home; However, if you live under poor conditions it can create stress hence intensifying your mental health state over time. Some would say that your home is a reflection of you in which it is. The environment that one lives in creates a personality that is usually captured by the cleanliness/ quality of that environment. Following that statement, the best way to remain stress/mental health free life, you should take the time to yourself to clean your home on a regular schedule, and figure out a pattern so that you can become more organized (Yes those clustered papers got to go!).
