              <blockquote>
                A question asked by many people is “Can my relationship status make a difference in the way that I act or in my health? Research shows that “strong partnerships can help us avoid illness, adopt healthier habits, and even live longer. On the other hand, troubled relationships tend to create stress and weaken immunity”. It is really important to understand your significant other while you are in a relationship. Not just knowing their favorite color but actually knowing them. Be willing to compromise. There are many different ways to nurture a healthy relationship but one is needed to practice a sense of gratitude. Expressing gratitude towards a partner can boost positivity for both people in the relationship. Don’t be fooled, relationships are are hard work. You need to invest time and in order to make it work you need to put forth effort. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Although, relationships can be a great thing for most people, it comes with a lot of work. Sometimes, relationships can affect your health in a negative way. Here are 3 things that you should look out for and try to strengthen in your relationship to stay healthy!
                <br>
                <br>
                1.Stress Levels are Higher
                <br>
                Whether it be work or school, many parts of your life including your “soulmate” are stressful. There are many relationships that lack compromisation which can lead to a stressful life. Disagreements over who gets what in the relationships, over money, and also, who disciplines the kids. These arguments have been shown to increase stress! Try to make sure you talk everything out in your relationship beforehand so that these arguments could be avoided. 
                <br>
                <br>
                2.   Gaining Weight 
                <br>
                According to a 2012 study, people tend to gain weight as soon as they start dating and then lose weight when they break up. While a happy couple can motivate each other to stay healthy, live happy, and go to the gym, the study states, “Dissatisfaction in the relationship can lead to passive aggressive eating behaviors and sleep problems, which leads to weight gain”. So although, a happy relationship can lead to more goals being set it could also lead to weight gain if you aren't satisfied with your partner. 
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Depression
                <br>
                <br>
                Being in a relationship can often lead to sadness or anxiety. Many studies have found that relationships can ease symptoms in people that family’s history involve depression. While happy relationships can do that, relationships in need of some work can increase symptoms of depression. In a study, it states, “women- regardless of their personal and family history of depression were six times more likely to be clinically depressed if their husbands had been unfaithful or if their marriages were breaking apart.” Break-ups and built-up stress can lead to depression. Each partner should make the other happy, of course relationships come with problems. Be sure to become strong enough to work through these obstacles and not make each other depressed.

It is really important to understand your significant other while you are in a relationship. Not just knowing their favorite color but actually knowing them. Be willing to compromise. Relationships take some hard work. You need to invest time and in order to make it work you need to put forth effort to ensure that you and your partner are living the best healthy life you can possibly live with each other.
